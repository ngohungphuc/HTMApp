Create a small and simple page using React. The page should load the properties from attached JSON and render them into the page, so that at least name and description are visible.

The page should also have a text input, and when text is entered into the field it should filter the displayed properties so that the property name or description should contain the text in that field. If no properties are displayed (due to filtering) then an error message should be shown.

You can use any additional tools and libraries, and can make it look however you want.
If you want to get going quickly, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) might help.

This task reflects basically what we have built already. If you need some inspiration or just interested, our current booking portals are here:

Once finished, please share the outcome with us (preferably in a zipped archive). If you could include the whole project so we can see the source code and also run/preview the result.

As well as functionality, we will be reviewing:
 - Usability
 - Code structure and style
 - Unit tests
